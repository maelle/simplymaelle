Source of my website
====================

Made with [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) thanks to the fantastic [`blogdown` book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I chose the theme [blackburn](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn) after seeing it used for [simplystatistics.org blog](https://github.com/rbind/simplystats). I've now tweaked it a lot, [referring to Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation).

The source of my old site is [here](https://github.com/maelle/oldsite).
