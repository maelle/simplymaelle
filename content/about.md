Bonjour ! Hello! Hallo! Hej! Hola! Hola! 

<img src="../img/barbie_office.jpg" alt="maelle" width="300">

Welcome on my website, where I showcase my working/goofing around with R. My posts are syndicated on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a> and featured in [R Weekly live feed](https://rweekly.org/live).

My last name is Salmon like the fish and the colour. My first name, Maëlle, is derived from a Celtic word that means princess or chief. It's pronounced "Ma-El" as "ma" in "macaroni" and as the Spanish "El". The accent on the e in ë doesn't change the pronounciation, so I guess it's my crown.

I [currently](/bio/) work as a (research) software engineer. Science took me places in Europe (UK, Sweden, Germany, Spain). I now live in Nancy, France. I like open-source, open data and open science.
