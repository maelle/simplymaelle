In these terrible times, we R people have more important subjects to debate/care about than `ggplot2` vs. base R graphics (isn't even worth discussing anyway, `ggplot2` is clearly the best alternative). Or so I thought until I saw [`CatterPlots`](https://github.com/Gibbsdavidl/CatterPlots) trending on Twitter this week and even being featured on [__Revolutions__ blog](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/02/catterplots-plots-with-cats.html). It was cool because plots with cats are cool, but looking more closely at the syntax of `CatterPlots`, I couldn't but realize it was probably a complot to make us all like base R graphics syntax again! So let me show you how to make a cute plot with the awesome `ggplot2` extension [`emojifont`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/emojifont).

The plot I'm going to re-make in this post is an old one already that I designed for celebrating [my PhD thesis](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19877/) submission in March last year. I decided to compare the gestation time of my thesis, 1246 days, to the gestation time of some common mammals.

# Getting data

I'm a bit ashamed because I forgot to write down where I took my data from but I'm pretty sure it was from reading Wikipedia pages and taking a more or less random numbers in the gestation time range indicated for each animals. I also chose animals I could find an emoji for. As you can imagine, it was quite an agreeable data collection. Here is what I end up with:


```r
library("dplyr")
library("forcats")
gestation <- readr::read_csv2("data/2017-02-18-complot.csv")%>%
  arrange(gestation) %>%
  mutate(animal = fct_rev(fct_inorder(animal)))
knitr::kable(gestation)
```



|animal    | gestation|label       |color |
|:---------|---------:|:-----------|:-----|
|mouse     |        19|mouse       |grey  |
|dog       |        61|dog         |grey  |
|cat       |        64|cat         |grey  |
|wolf      |        68|wolf        |grey  |
|tiger     |       105|tiger       |grey  |
|pig       |       112|pig         |grey  |
|sheep     |       144|sheep       |grey  |
|bear      |       220|bear        |grey  |
|human     |       280|baby        |grey  |
|whale     |       590|whale       |grey  |
|elephant  |       617|elephant    |grey  |
|my thesis |      1246|closed_book |gold  |

```r
levels(gestation$animal)
```

```
##  [1] "my thesis" "elephant"  "whale"     "human"     "bear"     
##  [6] "sheep"     "pig"       "tiger"     "wolf"      "cat"      
## [11] "dog"       "mouse"
```

I used `forcats::fct_inorder` and `forcats::fct_rev` because in such a post not using `forcats` would probably have been a deadly sin (and I don't have 7 lives), but also because I needed the levels to be ordered from longest to shortest gestation time, otherwise the plot would have looked ugly.

# Making the plot

At the time I used `gganimate` which I still love, but in the meantime I also fell in love with `magick` in particular since reading [Bob's post](https://rud.is/b/2016/07/27/u-s-drought-animations-with-the-witchs-brew-purrr-broom-magick/). So I decided to re-write my code with `magick`. On this blog I already published [an article featuring both `emojifont` and `gganimate`](/2017/01/27/catan/).


```r
library("ggplot2")
library("emojifont")
load.emojifont('OpenSansEmoji.ttf')
library("magick")
plot_one_gestation <- function(gestation_time, gestation){
  now_data <- filter_(gestation, ~ gestation <= gestation_time)
  p <- ggplot(now_data) 
  p <- p + geom_col(aes(x = animal,
               y = gestation,
               fill = color))
  p <- p +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey" = "grey30",
                               "gold" = "darkgoldenrod1")) 
  p <- p + geom_text(aes(x = animal, 
                y = gestation + 45,
                label = emoji(label)),
            family="OpenSansEmoji", size=30) 
  p <- p + theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        text = element_text(size=40),
        legend.position="none")
  p <- p + ggtitle(gestation_time)
  p <- p + scale_x_discrete(limits = levels(gestation$animal))
  p <- p + ylim(c(0, max(gestation$gestation) + 50)) 
  p <- p +  coord_flip() 
  p <- p + xlab("Animal") 
  p <- p + ylab("Gestation in days") 
  
  outfil <- paste0("figs/animals_", gestation_time, ".png")
  ggsave(outfil, p, width=5, height=5)

  outfil
}
```

I wanted the last image to be repeated 4 times so that everyone might have time to ponder over my accomplishment. I was celebrating _and_ boasting with this graph.


```r
library("purrr")
c(unique(gestation$gestation),
  rep(max(gestation$gestation), 3))%>%
  map(plot_one_gestation, gestation = gestation) %>%
  map(image_read) %>%
  image_join() %>%
  image_animate(fps=1) %>%
  image_write("gestation.gif")
```

<img src="/figure/gestation.gif" alt="gestation" width="700">

Aren't these animal emojis adorable? At least as adorable as `CatterPlots`cats? You can also bring emojis to `ggplot2` with [`emoGG`](https://github.com/dill/emoGG) (check out [Lucy's recent post](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/02/09/the-prevalence-of-drunk-podcasts/)) so you don't need to ever leave the comfort of `ggplot2` for the sake of "c[au]t[e]?ness".

Disclaimer: I actually starred `CatterPlots` on Github because I'm an open-minded cat person (married to a cat allergic person!).
