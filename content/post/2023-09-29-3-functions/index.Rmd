Straight from my sticky note, three functions that I like a lot, despite their not being new at all...
But maybe new to some of you?

## `sprintf()`, the dependency-free but less neat "glue"

Imagine I want to tell you who I am.

I could write

```{r}
name <- whoami::fullname()
github_username <- whoami::gh_username()
glue::glue("My name is {name} and you'll find me on GitHub as {github_username}!")
```

(Maybe the [whoami](https://r-lib.github.io/whoami/) package by Gábor Csárdi is a sub topic of this section?! So handy!)

The code above is very readable.
The nice syntax with curly braces is something one finds again in the [cli package](https://cli.r-lib.org/).[^cli]

[^cli]: Curious about cli? Come to this cool [rOpenSci coworkign session next week](https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2023-10/)!

Now, there's a dependency-free version of the glue code!
Albeit a bit uglier 🤐

```{r}
name <- whoami::fullname()
github_username <- whoami::gh_username()
sprintf(
  "My name is %s and you'll find me on GitHub as %s!",
  name,
  github_username
)
```

Sure it's less readable, since the replacements are identified by their position,
but I often find myself using it!
I clearly remember seeing it in other people's code and wondering what that was.

It's a pattern one finds in other languages: the manual page for the function states 
"Use C-style String Formatting Commands", and I know the [Hugo equivalent](https://gohugo.io/functions/printf/).

## `append()` and its after argument

To append values to a vector, I mostly use `c()`, but I recently discovered the base R function `append()` and its `after` argument that indicates where to include the new values!
By default, the values are appended at the end of the vector.

I most recently used `append()` to create a [test fixture](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/babeldown/blob/8e0fe9626c8ebe7cb70839b7751dfa803789107a/tests/testthat/test-translate-hugo.R#L12).

```{r}
x <- c("thing", "stuff", "element")
values <- c("bla", "blop")
append(x, values)
append(x, values, after = 2)
```

It's not a function I use every day, but it can come in handy depending on what you're doing!

For my fellow XML fans out there, it reminds me of the `.where` argument of `xml2::xml_add_sibling()` and `xml2::xml_add_child()`.

## `servr::httw()` to serve a local directory as a website

Do you know about the [servr package by Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/servr)?

Its use case is having a local directory that is the source of a website, and wanting to preview it locally in your browser as if it were served by a real server.

I make use of it when working on the babelquarto package for instance, that builds multilingual Quarto books or websites.
In the code of the multilingual books/websites, links to the other language versions are relative so they don't work if I simply open HTML files in my browser.
So, instead, I write `servr::httw(<directory-with-the-website-source>)`.

You can also use servr if you want to preview locally your pkgdown website and be able to use the [search function](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/search.html#bootstrap-5-built-in-search).

There's `servr::httw()` that watches changes in the directory, and the more simple `servr::httd()`.

## Conclusion

Today I shared about `sprintf()` for glue-like functionality, `append()` and its `after` argument for appending values where you want in a vector, and `servr::httw()` for serving static files.
