If you’ve been taught git and GitHub but practice so rarely that you’re discouraged, what should you do to re-start more easily? 
Let’s imagine you have to, or really want to, use git and GitHub for your next analysis project. 
Here's what I would recommend...

_I assume you already own a GitHub account. If not, refer to [happygitwithr guidance](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)._

## Clear notifications

This step is not completely necessary but could help you for the next re-start.
Look at your [GitHub notifications](https://github.com/notifications)!
Hopefully you weren’t getting them by email the whole time...

If you see you've been getting far too many notifications, tweak the settings!

* [Notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications);
* [Threads (issues, PRs) you are subscribed to](https://github.com/notifications/subscriptions);
* [Repositories you are watching](https://github.com/watching) (I find [custom watching](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) much more rewarding).

This way next time you open GitHub, your notifications should have a better signal to noise ratio.

Now if you notice you've been missing important notifications, try to either commit to log in more often or get those notifications out of GitHub and into your preferred system.
For instance, tell collaborators it's safer to email you. 
Another example: maybe don’t watch dplyr repository, but do subscribe to the Tidyverse blog.

## Inject a bit of motivation

Why are you doing this anyway? :sweat_smile:
Good reads are the ["Big picture" section of happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html) (by Jenny Bryan and collaborators) and the [Openscapes GitHub illustrated series](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/05/27/github-illustrated-series/) by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes.

## Check your R/GitHub situation

In this I assume you have R and RStudio IDE installed.
One problem at a time. :smile_cat:

Let's see if you have git correctly installed and hooked with GitHub, and remediate if not.
Run [`usethis::git_sitrep()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/git_sitrep.html).
Also run [`usethis::gh_token_help()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github-token.html).
Do not be surprised if your tokens expired since the last time you used GitHub from R.
When re-creating

You might also want to run the whole [usethis article about git and gitHub credentials](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).
On Linux, you might need [Managing GitHub credentials from R, difficulty level linux](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-08-08_git-credential-helpers/) by Danielle Navarro.

For git installation, refer to [happygitwithr guidance](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).

Do not be surprised if your tokens expired since the last time you used GitHub from R.
Also do not be surprised if it all takes a little while. Take notes on what you're doing. Next time you might be able to re-start after just running the two sitrep functions!
When re-creating tokens, make sure to give them an informative name (related to the computer you use them for, the project you use them for)

Usethis vignette about tokens
Look at your tokens on GitHub
Be careful what you call them

Optional
Do a full cycle
create_project(“../toy”)
use_git()
Add a file
Commit it
use_github()
Did it work?

Initiate your project right
use_git()
Beware of gitignore

Upload your project to GitHub
Organization or individual account? Why create an organization?
Private or public?
use_github()

Make commits as you work
Ideally: commits as an unit of change. Use a marble jar?
Realistically: commits before leaving your desk?
Push often.
Think about the idea of branches. 

Keep track of your TODOS
Use the issue tracker to write down ideas?

Put the “Closed” shield before you leave
Add a busy status on GitHub.
If you publish something, how should others contact you?
What expectations of fixes?

Procrastinate on your profile
Info
README
Pinned repositories

Schedule training sessions?
Not necessarily with another trainer, potentially just yourself!
Experimenting with branches and pull requests in your own toy repository, or your own real repository.
Make a first PR to a repo owned by someone else.
