I'm happy to report that I thought "oh but I know a better way to write that code!" a few times lately when reading old scripts of mine, or scripts by others.
It's a good feeling because it shows progress!
I've tooted about all three things I'll present in this post:
After reading Julia Evans' [post about blogging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/06/05/some-blogging-myths/), I decided to train the blogging muscle a bit using these low-hanging fruits/toots[^fruit].

[^fruit]: I hope it's a myth that your puns need to be good!

## Combine a list of default values with a list of custom values

[_Toot_](https://mastodon.social/@maelle/110134566950035337)

Imagine 💭  

🎚️  you have a `default_values` list and 
👇  want to let the user pass a `custom_values` list to override some of them.

✨ `utils::modifyList(default_values, custom_values) `does that!

So say you had code à la

```{r}
default_values <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
options <- list(b = 56)
temporary_list <- default_values
temporary_list[names(options)] <- options
options <- temporary_list

options
```

You can write it like so

```{r}
default_values <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
options <- list(b = 56)
options <- modifyList(default_values, options)
options
```

I learnt about that function in [pkgdown source](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/c354aa7e5ea1f9936692494c28c89e5bdd31fc68/R/utils.R#L109).

## Use a default if the user provided NULL

[_Toot_](https://mastodon.social/@maelle/110054745129675027)

Do you know the [rlang `%||%` operator](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/op-null-default.html)?[^pronounce]

Code like

```r
if (is.null(blop)) {
  blop <- 42
}
```

can become

```r
blop <- blop %||% 42
```

Related to this, I'd recommend package developers read the [chapter of the Tidyverse design guide on defaults](https://design.tidyverse.org/def-short.html), especially the section on the [`NULL` default](https://design.tidyverse.org/def-short.html#arg-short-null).

[^pronounce]: Please don't ask me to say this aloud, I have no idea how it's pronounced.

## Extract common values or different / unique values from two vectors

[_Toot_](https://mastodon.social/@maelle/110474929146978928)

Say I have a vector a and a vector b, and I need the unique a values that are not in b.

```{r}
a <- c("thing", "object")
b <- c("thing", "gift")
```

I tended to write something like

```{r}
unique(a[!(a %in% b)])
```

(or without the `unique()` if a has only distinct values)

that can be

```{r}
setdiff(a, b)
```

Similarly, when looking for the unique values of the two vectors combined, instead of 

```{r}
unique(c(a, b))
```

I can write

```{r}
union(a, b)
```

Because I've noticed I didn't know these base R functions well enough, I open the Set Operations manual page more often, by typing `?setdiff` for instance.

Salix Dubois helpfully noted the functions can be [slower](https://mastodon.social/@salixdubois@zeroes.ca/110477215577045367), and that one might not always want to drop duplicates.

## Conclusion

In this post I presented three basic (set of) functions (not all _base_ functions) that I've found serve me well: `utils::modifyList()`, `rlang::%||%` and base Set Operations.
I'm glad they're now part of my R vocabulary.

Note that you might still prefer the longer version of some of these patterns, depending on your needs, your code readers, etc. I won't judge!

I'm curious to see what three new things I'll have learnt in a few months (and will try not to beat myself up for not learning about them sooner :innocent:).
