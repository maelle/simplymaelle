I recently re-read [Nadia Eghbal's Working in public](https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public).
This time around, I noticed her mention of the book ["Producing open source software" by Karl Fogel](https://producingoss.com/).
Complying with my first-edition-curse, I did not notice there was a second edition online and soonish to be in print apparently, so I bought and read a second-hand first edition.

I really enjoyed it, and found myself refering to or thinking of parts of the books at work.
Kind of impressive for a 2005 book about open-source to have aged so well in at least some chapters.
Here are some of my highlights

## The Pompei projects :volcano:

In the introduction, the author says it's hard to define failures of open-source projects because often the project quietly dies.

> "There may be a moment when a final change is made to the project, but those who made it usually didn't know at the time that it was the last one."

When visiting old repositories, I often have the impression to visit a less dramatic version of Pompei.

At rOpenSci, we strive to [explicitly archive abandoned or retired packages](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/maintenance_evolution#archivalguidance).

## About motivations for participating in open-source.

To the questions "What will persuade all these people to stick together long enough to produce something useful?", Karl Fogel answers:

> "People should feel that their connection to a project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to their contributions."

A further aspect mentioned in the book is the idea that participants have a direct interest in the project because they, or their organization, use(s) it.

## "Appearances matter"

The author makes the point that by providing expected information in expected places in a nice way, you help potential users and contributors feel their time will not be wasted.

To me as an R package developer, "appearances matter" mean: please [switch your pkgdown website to Bootstrap 5](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#getting-started). :smile_cat: 
The small font size of the former template doesn't give me a good impression as I need to zoom. :grin:

## "Hacktivation energy"

## Conclusion

"Producing open-source software" was a nice read.
I don't want to read more things on screen, so will wait for the second edition to be in print to read it, but I am glad to have already read the first and feel it'd be a nice book to discuss with others.
It reminded me of Tracy Teal's posit conference workshop ["It's not just code: managing an open source project"](https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/managing-os-project/) that I didn't attend, but whose existence I found cool;
and of an rOpenSci community call I participated it in, ["Set Up Your Package to Foster a Community"](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/04/28/commcall-pkg-community/).
