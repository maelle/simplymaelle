I've just finished teaching blogging with R Markdown at R-Ladies Bangalore. This has two consequences: I need to calm down a bit, and I am inspired to, well, blog with R Markdown! As I've just read a [fascinating book about the beanie baby fad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821185-the-great-beanie-baby-bubble) and as I've seen rvest is getting an update, I've decided to harvest [Beaniepedia](https://beaniepedia.com). Both of these things show I spend too much time on Twitter, as the book has been tweeted about [by Vicky Boykis](https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1347575684802240512), and the package changes have been tweeted about [by Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1347260116932976643). I call that [staying up-to-date](/2019/01/25/uptodate/), of course.

So, as a little challenge for today, what are the most common animals among Beanie babies? Do I even need much webscraping to find this out?

How does one webscrape these days
---------------------------------

I've always liked webscraping, as I think I enjoy getting and transforming data more than I enjoy analyzing it. Compared to my former self,

-   I know a bit more about XPath (starting with knowing it exists!) so I don't use regular expression to parse HTML.
-   I use [polite](https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/) for polite webscraping!
-   I know it's best to spend more time pondering about strategies before hammering requests at a website.

As to rvest recent changes, I had a quick look at the [changelog](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/news/index.html) but since I hadn't used it in so long, it's not as if I had any habit to change!

How to harvest Beaniepedia
--------------------------

I've noticed Beaniepedia has a [sitemap for all beanies](view-source:https://beaniepedia.com/beanies/sitemap.xml) so from that I can extract the URLs to all Beanie pages. That's a necessary step.

Now from there I could either

-   Scrape each of this page, respectfully slowly, and extract the table that includes the beanie's information;
-   Use a more frugal strategy by parsing URLs. E.g. from the path of `https://beaniepedia.com/beanies/beanie-babies/january-the-birthday-bear-series-2/` I can extract the category of the Beanie (a beanie baby as opposed to, say, an attic treasure) and the animal by splitting `january-the-birthday-bear-series-2` into pieces and see whether one is an animal. How would I recognize animals? By using an rcorpora dataset.

I'll choose the second strategy and leave the first one as an exercise to the reader. :wink:

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span class='c'># I found the right argument via rcorpora::categories() </span>
<span class='c'># and rcorpora::corpora(category = "animals")</span>

<span class='c'>#&gt; [1] "aardvark"  "alligator" "alpaca"    "antelope"  "ape"       "armadillo"</span>
</code></pre>

</div>

Let's get to work! A *sine qua non* condition is obviously the website being ok with our scraping stuff. The polite package would tell us whether the robots.txt file were against our doing this, and I also took time looking whether the website had any warning. I didn't find any so I think we're good to go.

The `sitemap` object is an XML document. I will extract URLs with the xml2 package.

<div class="highlight">

</div>

Now I need to parse the URLs. In an URL path like `beanies/beanie-babies/jerry-the-minion-2/` the second part is the category, the third part is the Beanie Baby name. I, as if I were a good collector :upside_down_face:, am not interested in Attic treasures, only in Beanie Babies.

This gives me 632 Beanie babies. Let's parse the last part of their path.

Will "jemima-puddle-duck-the-duck" be a problem? Hopefully not. Now for each parsed path let's see whether it corresponds to any common animal.
