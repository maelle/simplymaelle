As 2018 nears its end, it’s time for me to look back on my R/Twitter
year with the same simple method as [last
year](/2017/12/30/best9of2017/): let me identify and webshoot my 9 best
tweets of 2018!

Downloading and opening my Twitter data
=======================================

Like in 2017 I tweeted too much and therefore was unable to rely on
`rtweet::get_timeline()` (or `rtweet::get_my_timeline()`) to download my
tweets so I exported data via the Tweets tab of
<https://analytics.twitter.com/>. Last year, I downloaded one file per
quarter but somehow had to download one per month this time. It was
monotonous but not horrible.

``` r
library("magrittr")

dir("data", full.names = TRUE) %>%
  purrr::map_df(readr::read_csv) %>%
  unique() -> my_tweets
```

4196 tweets!

Getting the top 9 tweets
========================

Similarly to my 2017 post, I chose the number of likes as criterion to
define my best tweets.

``` r
my_tweets <- dplyr::arrange(my_tweets, - likes)
my_tweets <- janitor::clean_names(my_tweets)

knitr::kable(my_tweets[1:9, "likes"])
```

|  likes|
|------:|
|    162|
|    151|
|    128|
|    112|
|     95|
|     94|
|     91|
|     86|
|     75|

``` r
best9 <- my_tweets$tweet_permalink[1:9]
```

The table above shows that my best tweets were not *extremely* popular.

Webshooting and combining the tweets
====================================

My 2017 blog post inspired Bob Rudis to contribute a `tweet_shot()`
function to `rtweet`, relying on the `webshot` package, so that’s what I
used.

``` r
shot <- function(permalink){
  rtweet::tweet_shot(permalink) %>%
    magick::image_crop(magick::geometry_area(width = 517,
                                             height = 517,
                       y_off = 88)) %>%
    magick::image_border("salmon", "20x20")
}

images <- purrr::map(as.character(best9),
                     shot)
```

I improved the collage code with two tweaks:

-   I created rows then columns instead of the other way round, because
    that’s what Instagram does. I did not pay attention to this last
    year but Andrew Caines told me this in a comment.

-   I did not save the intermediary images to disk. I’ve upped my
    `magick` game!

``` r
make_row <- function(i, images){
  images[((i-1)*3+1):((i-1)*3+3)] %>%
    magick::image_join() %>%
    magick::image_append()
}

purrr::map(1:3, make_row,
           images = images) %>%
  magick::image_join() %>%
  magick::image_append(stack = TRUE) %>%
  magick::image_border("salmon", "20x20")
```

Worth noting from my R year are, according to these tweets,

-   my re-designing [my website](https://masalmon.eu/);

-   the slides of my R-Ladies Strasbourg talk [about how to be a
    resilient R user](https://maelle.github.io/fluctuat_nec_mergitur/);

-   my [starting work](https://masalmon.eu/bio/) at rOpenSci and Locke
    Data (yay!);

-   my blog post about [rainbowing a set of
    pictures](https://masalmon.eu/2018/01/07/rainbowing/);

-   another blog post featuring `magick`, about [combining
    hexes](https://masalmon.eu/2018/02/22/hexcombine/) but I’d recommend
    reading [this post by Mitchell O’Hara
    Wild](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/user-2018-feature-wall/)
    instead;

-   my blog post about [where to get R
    help](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/22/wheretogethelp/) that might be
    the personal blog post I’m the proudest of.

What about your R year, on Twitter and elsewhere? Have a good last days
of 2018, and a happy 2019!
