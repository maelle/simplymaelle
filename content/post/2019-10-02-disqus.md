Removing Disqus from my blogdown blog had been on my mind for a while,
ever since I saw [Bob Rudis’ tweet enjoining Noam Ross to *not* use
it](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr/status/1135915244532822018) for [his
brand-new website](https://www.noamross.net/2019/08/09/a-new-website/).
The same Twitter thread introduced me to
[Utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances), a “lightweight
comments widget built on GitHub issues”, which I have at last installed
to my blog in lieu of Disqus. How did I manage to not lose anything of
value? How easy was it to switch tools? Read on to learn more!

Was saying goodbye to Disqus hard?
==================================

Removing Disqus was neither emotionally nor technically hard.

Comments I (kinda) let go of
----------------------------

To deal with my fear of loss, I [exported all the comments to an
XML](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717199-importing-exporting#exporting-from-disqus).
It means I have a backup, that in theory I could explore within R! I’ll
show some XML wrangling a bit later. The export does contain Disqus
usernames and names which means I’m now responsible for person
identifying information that Disqus collected.

*Thanks a lot to commenters in the past system for taking the time to
leave me a note: it helped me keep blogging!*

The Disqus XML contains information about

-   *posts* that are in fact comments, not *blog* posts, along with
    their threading information i.e. both whose blog post the comment
    was on, and if relevant, which comment the comment is an answer to;

-   *threads*, one thread per comment but not necessarily one comment
    per thread, and potentially more than one thread per blog post. Each
    top-level comment is a thread, but a website page with no comment
    also gets a thread, obviously empty.

In the code below, I shall
[*rectangle*](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/data-rectangling-1) the
information about threads (id, title) and about comments (message,
author name, date, thread id, was it spam, was it deleted) using the
[`xml2`
package](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#recommended-scaffolding).

``` r
export <- xml2::read_xml("data/disqus-export.xml")
export
```

Explaining how to parse XML is beyond the scope of this blog post, but
let me just mention I used a search engine to answer questions such as
“XPath extract nodes by name”, “xml2 namespace”. I reckon my code could
be more elegant if I knew more XPath.

Let me start with threads.

``` r
# extract nodes corresponding to comments
threads_nodes <- xml2::xml_find_all(export, "d1:thread")
threads_nodes
```

``` r
# extract interesting information from each node,

comments <- tibble::tibble(
  thread_id = xml2::xml_attr(
    xml2::xml_find_all(comments_nodes, "d1:thread"), 
    "id"),
  message = xml2::xml_text(
    xml2::xml_find_all(comments_nodes, "d1:message")
    ),
  date =  xml2::xml_text(
    xml2::xml_find_all(comments_nodes, "d1:createdAt")
    ),
  deleted = xml2::xml_text(
    xml2::xml_find_all(comments_nodes, "d1:isDeleted")
    ),
  spam = xml2::xml_text(
    xml2::xml_find_all(comments_nodes, "d1:isSpam")
    ),
  author = xml2::xml_text(
    xml2::xml_find_all(
    xml2::xml_find_all(comments_nodes, "d1:author"), 
    "d1:name")))
  
comments <- dplyr::mutate(comments,
                          date = anytime::anydate(date),
                          deleted = deleted == "true",
                          spam = spam == "true")
```

I was then able to join the two tables.

``` r
comments <- dplyr::left_join(comments, threads,
                             by = "thread_id")
readr::write_csv(comments, "comments.csv")

comments[2:12, c("message", "title")]
```

I got a pretty nice rectangle in the end, that could be used for some
text analysis, but in my case, I mostly view it as memorabilia. I hope
any comment warranting action had been tackled. I wrote 93
(`sum(comments$author == "Maëlle Salmon")`) out of the 206 comments
(Disqus classified a few comments as spam, 15 to be exact, of which a
few were informative comments. ), because I tend to answer comments, if
only with a simple thank you! Now that I have GitHub issues as comments,
I could also answer with emojis.

It was fun because I didn’t even remember about some notes I had gotten.
I hope you don’t feel slighted, dear reader, now that I keep these old
comments to myself! Be happy you’re no longer tracked.

Getting rid of Disqus
---------------------

I removed Disqus from my website, and my website from Disqus!

To remove Disqus from a Hugo website, one can, depending on the
website’s theme:

-   use [Hugo’s Disqus GDPR
    setting](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/) if the website
    theme uses Hugo’s built-in Disqus template (i.e. if there’s a
    mention of a [internal Disqus
    partial](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#use-the-disqus-template),
    not of a Disqus partial stored somewhere in the theme files);

-   or remove one’s Disqus username from the config file, or remove the
    Disqus partial mention in the post template. To do that, the best
    process is not to edit the e.g. post/single.html file in the theme
    folder, but instead to save it and edit it under
    layouts/post/single.html. [Refer to the blogdown book for more
    information](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/custom-layouts.html).

After that, there should be no mention of Disqus scripts in your website
source.

Then, to delete my website from my Disqus account, following [Disqus
guidance](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717289-how-do-i-remove-my-site),
I logged into my account and, *after exporting my website’s comments*,
confirmed I wanted to do that and voilà!

Adding Utterances
=================

To add Utterances, a “lightweight comments widget built on GitHub
issues”, I also followed [official
guidance](https://utteranc.es/#configuration):

-   I installed the app to my website GitHub repo.

-   In my custom single.html layout for posts (again, [refer to the
    blogdown book for clear information on the
    topic](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/custom-layouts.html)), I
    added the script tag corresponding to Utterances. The docs linked
    above help you configure the appearance of the widget.

Here’s the Utterances script tag for my blog. The label needs to [have been created for your website repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-label)tterances can only use existing issue labels.

``` html
<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="maelle/simplymaelle"
        issue-term="title"
        label="comments :speech_balloon:"
        theme="github-light"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

I then wrote a comment under [one of my
posts](https://masalmon.eu/2019/01/25/uptodate/) to make sure things
worked. I also took a few seconds to [add my site to the list of sites
using Utterances](https://utteranc.es/#sites-using-utterances). Overall,
I found the process easy, as I had the first time I installed Utterances
[on a blogdown website](https://blog.r-hub.io/).

I am aware that a downside of Utterances is that it is tied to GitHub.
However, I am not afraid of switching to yet another tool in the future,
and hope not too many potential commenters will be turned off by the
necessity to use a GitHub account to comment.

Conclusion
==========

In this post I explained how I removed Disqus from my blog and vice
versa, and how I installed Utterances instead. What I did not do was
analyzing the Disqus data. I moreover did not try to *transfer* old
comments to the new system, partly because that’d mean removing
commenters’ ownership on what they had written.

In [his tweet that motivated me to say goodbye to
Disqus](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr/status/1135915244532822018), Bob
wrote *“Yet another service where you and your site visitors are the
product. Plus it acts like malicious javascript.”*. I therefore feel a
bit better about this website! Now, I didn’t have a ton of comments, and
I don’t have a real need for moderating comments, so maybe you’ll make a
different decision for your website. I’d be glad to hear about it… in
the comments section below! Also feel free to tell me if you explore
your own Disqus data in a more thorough way than I!
