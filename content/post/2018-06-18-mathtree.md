It's nearly been two years since I defended [my PhD thesis](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19877/)! On top of allowing me to call myself _doctor_, having a PhD in _statistics_ gives me the honour to feature in the data of the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/). Today, I decided to webscrape my mathematical ancestors.

# My blogging ancestors?

Before blogging, following [my own advice](https://maelle.github.io/rladiesseattle/slides#14) I googled my idea and found these similar efforts:

* Nathalie Vialaneix scraped her own mathematical tree using the R `XML` package and drew it using the `igraph` package and `GraphViz`. My post is basically a remix of [her post](http://tuxette.nathalievilla.org/?p=1292).

* [Heike Hofmann](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nooodak.edu/id.php?id=46503) started writing [a package to scrape the Mathematical Genealogy Project](https://github.com/heike/mathGen), and apparently abandoned it.

* [Thibault Vatter](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=202169) published a [GitHub repo mixing R, Python and a tool called Scrapy to scrape the website](https://github.com/tvatter/mgpancestry).

I wrote my own version of the webscraping because I wanted to use [`rvest`](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) like I usually do these days.

# Scraping the Mathematical Genealogy Project

Now that I have added [tags to all my old blog posts](https://masalmon.eu/tags/), I can look back at my [previous webscraping efforts](https://masalmon.eu/tags/webscraping/) and use my recent scripts... as well as see how much progress I made since my reckless webscraping days, when I didn't check I was allowed to webscrape, and when I used on string manipulation rather than XPath and friends.

Nowadays before webscraping I use [the rOpenSci `robotstxt` package](https://github.com/ropensci/robotstxt) to read what the website owners will let me do.

``` r
> robotstxt::robotstxt("https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu")$text
User-agent: msnbot
Crawl-delay: 30

User-agent: Browsershots
Disallow: 

User-agent: *
Disallow: /submit-data.php
> robotstxt::paths_allowed("https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php")

 www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu
[1] TRUE
```

From the above I deduced that

* there is no recommended delay for scrapers that are not msnbot, so I used 5 seconds between calls, which seemed [_lagom_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom).

* I was allowed to scrape mathematicians' pages. Hooray!

Then, I looked at the code of my [most recent webscraping blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2018/05/06/dsstock/) that was building on [code by Bob Rudis](https://gist.github.com/hrbrmstr/4cabe4af87bd2c5fe664b0b44a574366): after looking at the source of one mathematician's page, I used `html_attrs` and `html_text` to extract the elements I needed from each page.

```r
.get_advisors <- function(id_string, sleep_time){
  # small break to be nice
  Sys.sleep(sleep_time)
  
  # try to get the page
  page <- glue::glue("https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/{id_string}") %>%
  httr::GET() 
  
  # try until it works but not more than 5 times
  try <- 1
  while(httr::status_code(page) != 200 & try <= 5){
    Sys.sleep(sleep_time)
    page <- glue::glue("https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/{id_string}") %>%
      httr::GET() 
    try = try + 1
  }
  
  # Now get student's name
  student_name <- httr::content(page) %>%
    rvest::xml_nodes(xpath = '//h2[@style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.5ex; margin-top: 1ex"]') %>%
    rvest::html_text() %>%
    stringr::str_remove("\\\n")
  
  # Get all nodes corresponding to advisors
  # Thanks to their... formatting but it works
  all_advisors <- httr::content(page) %>%
  rvest::xml_nodes(xpath = "//p[@style='text-align: center; line-height: 2.75ex']") %>%
    rvest::html_nodes("a")
  
  # Export results
  tibble::tibble(student_name = student_name,
                 id_string_student = id_string,
                 name = purrr::map_chr(all_advisors, rvest::html_text),
                 id_string = purrr::map_chr(all_advisors, rvest::html_attr,
                                            "href"))
}

```

Now, since sometimes advisors will be encountered more than once in the data, I used `memoise` to create a handy function wrapper that will cache results.

```r
# Cache results in case a mathematician comes up several times
get_advisors <- memoise::memoise(.get_advisors)
```

Finally, to get all my ancestors, I had to iteratively get the ancestors of each of my ancestors... until when? Heike Hofmann wrote a function working a given number of steps, Nathalie Vialaneix stopped when there was no advisor on an advisor's page, I stopped when the data.frame stopped growing because that's what I found the easiest to implement.

```r
me <- "id.php?id=207686"
# initial data.frame
df <- get_advisors(me, 5)
new_df <- df
keep_growing <- TRUE
while(keep_growing){
  # get size to compare to size after a bit more scraping
  nrow1 <- nrow(df)
  # get advisors for all new lines 
  # from the previous iterations
  new_df <- purrr::map_df(new_df$id_string, get_advisors, sleep_time = 30)
  df <- unique(rbind(df, new_df))
  # if the data.frame didn't grow, stop
  if(nrow(df) == nrow1){
    keep_growing <- FALSE
  }
}

# save results
readr::write_csv(df, "math_ancestry.csv")
```

I tested the above on very ancient mathematicans who didn't have too many ancestors to check it was working, and stopping.

At the end of my data gathering, I had a nice table of 261 mathematicians including yours truly! By the way, the Mathematical Genealogy Project maintainers [state](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/mission.php) "Throughout this project when we use the word "mathematics" or "mathematician" we mean that word in a very inclusive sense. Thus, all relevant data from mathematics education, statistics, computer science, or operations research is welcome." which is the reason why I feel fine calling myself a mathematician in this post.

# Showing (off) my mathematical family tree

The approach I used below, defining nodes and edges for integration by [`DiagrammeR`](https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR) before exporting to [`igraph`](https://github.com/igraph/rigraph) and then to [`GraphViz`](http://www.graphviz.org/) (not an R package, but interfaced by both `DiagrammeR` and `igraph`), might seem a bit complicated since the `DiagrammeR` package itself exports to `GraphViz` format... but not with the classic default look I liked on Nathalie's Vialaneix blog.

```r

library("magrittr")
library("DiagrammeR")

# create nodes
labels <-  unique(c(df$student_name, df$name))
nodes_df <- create_node_df(n = length(labels))
nodes_df$label <- labels

# create edges
edges_df <- df[, c("name", "student_name")]
edges_df <- dplyr::left_join(edges_df, nodes_df,
                             by = c("name" = "label"))
edges_df <- dplyr::rename(edges_df, from = id)
edges_df <- dplyr::left_join(edges_df, nodes_df,
                             by = c("student_name" = "label"))
edges_df <- dplyr::rename(edges_df, to = id)

# special character that'd make GraphViz throw an error
nodes_df <- dplyr::mutate(nodes_df,
                   label = stringr::str_replace_all(label, "'", " "))

# create a DiagrammeR dgr_graph object
dgr <- create_graph(nodes_df = nodes_df,
                    edges_df = edges_df[, c("to", "from")],
                    directed = TRUE)

# export the object to igraph format
# and then write it to a GraphViz DOT file
DiagrammeR::to_igraph(dgr) %>%
  igraph::write.graph(file = "graph.dot",
                      format = "dot") 

```

I vaguely got the ambition to use some sort of htmlwidget to have a zoomable and pretty network but didn't want to spent too much time doing it, so PNGs it is! Here is how I hacked my way to a PNG.

```r
DiagrammeR::grViz("graph.dot") %>%
  htmlwidgets::saveWidget("lala.html")

webshot::webshot("lala.html",
                 selector="#htmlwidget_container",
                 file = "tree.png",
                 zoom = 10)
file.remove("lala.html")
```

I then cropped two zooms by hand!

So here is my whole tree...

<img src="/figure/source/2018-06-18-mathtree/tree.png" alt="my math family tree" width="600">

It is unreadable unless you open it in its own tab and zoom. Like Nathalie Vialaneix, I think I only have male mathematical ancestors.

<img src="/figure/source/2018-06-18-mathtree/zoom1.png" alt="zoom 1 on my math family tree" width="600">

The most recent part of the tree obviously features my PhD advisor [Michael Höhle](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=168176), who by the way has [a very smart statistics blog](http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/)! I also see I'm related to CRAN's [Kurt Hornik](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=79783), which doesn't mean I get my packages on CRAN whilst bypassing gatekeeping though.

I was then very pleased to recognize some famous mathematicians' names, not the most ancient ones I'm afraid, but look, Poisson! I was very excited about this because my PhD thesis featured count data, and because Poisson means fish in French... So maybe I'm a fish after all. Besides, seeing Carl Friedrich Gauß also made me happy... I had no idea the picture below was actually a family portrait!


# Growing this post?

In conclusion, I scraped and drew my mathematical family tree using data from the Mathematical Genealogy Project. Extensions of my post could include making a package like Heike Hofmann's one to make it easier for anyone to get their data; preparing a nicer visualization (note that you can buy posters to support the project as explained on [this page](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/posters.php)), and getting more data from each mathematician's page to draw once's ancestry on a map, summarize thesis topics with tidy text analysis... Now, I'll probably remain the black sheep of my mathematical family by blogging about [kitsch plots](https://masalmon.eu/tags/kitsch-plot/)!
