OpenAQ is a non-profit fighting air inequality by harmonizing disparate real-time and historical AQ open data.
In my talk (starting shortly after 38:00 of the recording) I explained how to get OpenAQ data into R via [my own ropenaq package](https://docs.ropensci.org/ropenaq/), and via Amazon Web Services Athena.
