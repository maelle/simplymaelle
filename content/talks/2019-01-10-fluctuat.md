Fluctuat nec mergitur: How to be a resilient R user. We will deal with seeking for assistance on R's oceans: how to get help, how to keep up-to-date. 

I also gave the talk at [R-Ladies Strasbourg on 2018-10-26](https://www.meetup.com/es/rladies-strasbourg/events/255348307/), and at [R-Ladies San Jose (remotely) on 2019-01-21](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-san-jose/events/dbnnkpydcfbcb/).
