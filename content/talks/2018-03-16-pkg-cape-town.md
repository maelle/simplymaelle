 This hands-on workshop will allow you to transform a bunch of R functions into an R package. You'll also learn how to make it usable and used! We'll assume you can write functions, and a basic familiarity with Git & GitHub.

Here is what we'll learn:

* Why develop a package?

* What is in a package?

* devtools workflow to create a package

* Automatic tools for improving a package, from R CMD Check to linting

* Creating a slick documentation website with pkgdown

* Why and how to have your package reviewed?

* How to make your package famous or at least reach your audience?

* Package analytics via CRAN logs and via the gh package.

Attendees should bring a laptop with the latest versions of R and RStudio installed. Also bring your experience and questions about packages!
