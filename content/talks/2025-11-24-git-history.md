A confident Git practice can change the working life of anyone writing code or prose with R, resulting
in a useful history to browse or inspect, the ability to work in parallel on different aspects, and so on.
In particular, the best Git practice is to create small atomic commits with informative messages. But
why? And how? Learn three reasons why small Git commits are worthwhile. Find out how to create
them realistically, without too much hassle. Practice safely with the saperlipopette R package, and
share your own Git tips and questions! I will use playgrounds created by saperlipopette to illustrate Git
techniques and strategies. The participants can then re-create the exact same playgrounds and practice
before we move on to the next topic. This tutorial will therefore be active and engaging! 
Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Git (git add, git commit, git push/pull, branch creation, merging branches on a
platform like GitHub). 
- Local installation of Git. https://happygitwithr.com/install-git + https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git 
- Install saperlipopette. https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/ 
- I’ll
do two demos using Positron (the other ones in RStudio IDE) https://positron.posit.co/, if you want
to test too you can install it and install the GitLens extension. But the exercises can be done no matter
in which interface you use R and Git!
