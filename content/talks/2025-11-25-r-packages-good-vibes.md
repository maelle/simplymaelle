Institutional toolboxes are time savers and help with continuity of organizations’ activities.
These toolboxes can be made even more useful and delightful to work with through well-designed curation that cultivates quality at both the package and collection level. 
In this talk, I will explain how your organization can apply lessons, guidance and tooling from the rOpenSci package review system to strengthen code and interface quality, and improve statistical robustness; how your organization can rely on R-universe to officially onboard your organization’s packages, to then easily distribute and showcase them. 
All of this in a kind, accessible and constructive atmosphere like the one we strive to curate at
