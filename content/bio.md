* I'm fluent in the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language, including package development, more info [on my Github profile](https://github.com/maelle). I've written many documents with LaTeX, including a [book](http://www.editions-ellipses.fr/product_info.php?products_id=7159) and [my PhD thesis](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19877/). I built this website with [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) using [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), using the [blackburn Hugo theme](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn) by looking at [the simplystatistics blog](https://simplystatistics.org). I am a master at googling and copy-pasting from [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and I'm frustration-resistant. Besides, I'm fond of data surfing.

* My mother tongue is French. I've learnt Spanish and Catalan. I've learnt Italian too but don't practice much so I mostly only understand it. I also speak English, German, Swedish and I know a bit of Dutch.

I like running and other sports that don't challenge my coordination too much. Running makes me red and happy.
