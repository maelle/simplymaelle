   "abstract": "osmdata imports OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into R as either Simple Features or R Spatial objects, respectively able to be processed with the R packages sf and sp. OSMdata are extracted from the Overpass API and processed with very fast C++ routines for return to R. The package enables simple Overpass queries to be constructed without the user necessarily understanding the syntax of the Overpass query language, while retaining the ability to handle arbitrarily complex queries. Functions are also provided to enable recursive searching between different kinds of OSM data (for example, to findall lines which intersect a given point). The package is faster than current alternatives for importing OSM data into R and is the only one compatible with sf."
